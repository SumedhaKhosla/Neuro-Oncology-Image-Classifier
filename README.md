# Neuro-Oncology-Image-Classifier : Brain Tumor Image Classification and Analysis

# Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive set of tools and visualizations for brain tumor image classification. The project includes various analyses and graphical representations of image data from a dataset containing images categorized into different classes: glioma, meningioma, notumor, and pituitary. The aim is to provide insights into the dataset through various plots and visualizations, which can help in understanding the distribution and characteristics of the images.

# Features

1. Dataset Visualization:

Distribution of classes in the dataset.
Sample images from each class.

2. Image Augmentation:

Visualization of original and augmented images.
Example augmentations include horizontal flips and rotations.

3. Image Dimensions:

Plot and analyze the dimensions of images in the training and testing datasets.

4. Class Distribution Graphs:

Graphical representation of the distribution of classes.
Comparison of the number of images per class.

5. Histogram of Pixel Intensities:

Plot histograms for pixel intensity distributions.
Compare pixel intensity distributions across different tumor classes.

6. Class and Augmented Image Display:

Display a grid of sample images and their augmented versions.
